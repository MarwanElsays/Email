[CONVERGENCE CHECK]
===================

	num of higher or equal <- 0
	for i from 0 to number of rows:
		sum <- 0
		for j from 0 to number of columns:
			if j equals i then skip iteration
			else sum <- sum + absolute(matrix[i][j])
		endfor
		if matrix[i][i] > sum: then (num of higher) <- (num of higher) + 1
		if matrix[i][i] >= sum: then (num of higher or equal) <- (num of higher or equal) + 1
		if matrix[i][i] < sum then: not convergent: is_convergent <- false and exit the check
	endfor

if (number of higher or equal) equals number of diagonal elements and (number of higher) not zero
	then is_convergent <- true
